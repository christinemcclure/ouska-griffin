         Over the counter supports, even “fitted ones” will not relieve pain as well as a custom orthotic made specifically for you and matched for intended use. Image generated and foam impressions made with the patient standing only recreate the deformity with the foot under pressure. The skill is in the non-weight bearing, neutral position, cast impression controlled by an experienced podiatrist.

         There are multiple styles of custom orthotics for dress, work, and sport shoes. Many insurance companies will cover multiple sets.

        <p>
         Like shoes, custom orthotics are not designed for a lifetime of use. What once worked may not be doing the job today. Our foot’s biomechanics change as we age. Changes in your daily activities may place new demands on your feet as well. Either may warrant an evaluation of your current orthotic needs.

  <h4>Custom orthotic refurbishing</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="large-8 columns">
        <p>
         Maybe the structural benefits of your current orthotics are fine but they need refurbishing. The replacement of top covers both shock absorbing and leather materials enhance the comfort of your supports. Wearing ripped or frayed top covers can cause blisters and bruising to soles and toes. Refurbishing is inexpensive and does not require new casting.
