Ingrown toenails (onychocryptosis) is a common condition in which the corner or side of a toenail, usually the big toe, grows into the soft skin. Symptoms include pain, redness, and swelling and, sometimes, drainage caused by a bacterial infection. They can be hereditary, caused by a poor fitting shoe, an errant trimming of the nail or repeated trauma from walking or running. Other than soaking in warm water at home and using a topical antibiotic, treatment requires a sterile environment, the proper tools, and the skills of a podiatrist. Fortunately, once removed, relief and recovery is quick.

<p>Dr. Ouska-Griffin uses a conservative two step approach.</p>

  <p>First, the offending nail area is removed by an in-office sterile procedure with local numbing around the offending area. This first step does not remove the nail bed from which the nail grows. If the ingrown toe nail returns, which is common, or becomes chronic, a second step can be done at a later date - the offending nail section and a small section of the nail bed is removed by a simple in-office procedure. This second step results in a permanent fix in nearly all cases.</p>
  
  <p>Ways to avoid ingrown toenails:</p>
        
        <ul class="indented">
          <li>Don't cut down the corners of the toenails.</li>
          <li>Don't trim toenails too short.</li>
          <li>Don't wear improperly fitting shoes such one with a very narrow or pointed toe area.</li>
          <li>Butâ€¦.remember ingrown toenails may be genetic and require permanent removal.</li>
        </ul>
