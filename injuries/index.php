Painful injuries will ruin any day in our busy lives. Stubbing or breaking a toe can slow us down to a crawl along with sprains and acute heel pain.  Even an insect bite or a longer than normal walk-or wearing that pair of flats can result in a painful foot. Most foot injuries are quick to diagnose and are resolved by a straight-forward treatment plan by Dr. Ouska-Griffin.

On site x-rays make it possible to evaluate and treat most injuries in one visit. Treatment may include application of compressive dressing or ace wrap, crutches, and or cast boot and appropriate pain medication. MRI imaging may be needed in more serious injuries. If there is a soft tissue injury then appropriate protective therapeutic treatments can be discussed and a prescription for physical therapy can be dispensed. Swelling and pain are never normal and should be evaluated as soon as possible.

Some helpful hints: If you do injure your foot think R.I.C.E. which stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation, and call us immediately for a consultation. For instance, if you sprain your ankle and it hurts and swells up, you should try to rest it using crutches, and ice the top and sides of the ankle 10 to 15 minutes on every half hour using a cloth covered ice pack. Also apply an ace wrap to the ankle with gentle compression all day BUT NOT WHEN SLEEPING. As much as possible keep the injured part up on pillows higher than the heart when resting. Over the counter medications such as ibuprofen may be indicated but call your podiatrist.
