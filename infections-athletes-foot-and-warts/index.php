There are many different types of foot infections, some simple, and others complex. They are categorized into 3 groups: soft tissue, bone, and diabetic foot infections. Signs of infection may include increased pain, swelling, redness, or warmth around the affected area red streaks extending from the affected area, pus draining from the area. Many events can be responsible for soft tissue infections. A description of soft tissue infections includes simple, moderate, and severe infections, Bone can be involved when an infectious process is present in the foot because of the close proximity to the skin and lack of a thick, soft tissue, protective layer throughout most parts of the foot. People with diabetes who get an infection are at high risk for complications such as ulcerations in the feet, which often lead to serious infection of the soft tissue and bones.

      <h2>Athlete's foot</h2>
  </div>    
  <div class="large-9 columns">
        <p>
Athlete's foot is a common fungal skin infection that grows on or in the top layer of skin, especially in warm, wet places, such as between the toes. Athlete's foot can make your feet and the skin between your toes burn and itch. The skin may peel and crack. Athlete's foot spreads easily. You can get it by touching the toes or feet of a person who has it. But most often, people get it by walking barefoot on contaminated surfaces near swimming pools or in locker rooms. Athlete's foot may persist for long periods. Consequently, the infection may be spread by contaminated bed sheets or clothing to other parts of the body. The fungus can then grow in your shoes, especially if your shoes are so tight that air cannot move around your feet. Some people are more likely than others to get athlete's foot. After you have had athlete's foot, you are more likely to get it again.

        <p>See a podiatrist if the infection last over two weeks.</p>

          <li>Avoid walking barefoot; use shower shoes</li>
          <li>Reduce perspiration by using talcum powder</li>
          <li>Wear light and airy shoes</li>
          <li>Change shoes and hose regularly to decrease moisture</li>

      <h2>Plantar warts</h2>
  </div>    
  <div class="large-9 columns">
        <p>
Plantar warts are caused by a viral infection, the human papillomavirus (HPV). The virus enters your body through tiny cuts, breaks or other weak spots on the bottom of your feet, especially the heel or ball of the foot. The many viruses that cause warts generally invade the skin through small or invisible cuts and abrasions. The plantar wart is often contracted by walking barefoot on dirty surfaces or littered ground or public, semiprivate showers where the virus is lurking. If left untreated, warts can grow to an inch or more in circumference and can spread into clusters of several warts. Plantar warts are contagious and are spread by touching, scratching, or even by contact with skin shed from another wart. The wart may also bleed, creating another route for spreading. Warts can be very resistant to treatment and have a tendency to reoccur. Over-the-counter preparations contain acids or chemicals that destroy skin cells. It takes an expert to destroy abnormal skin cells (warts) without also destroying surrounding healthy tissue. Self-treatment with such medications are effective in an estimated 50% of cases. Over the counter treatments should be avoided by people with diabetes and those with cardiovascular or circulatory disorders. Never use these medications in the presence of an bacterial active infection.
